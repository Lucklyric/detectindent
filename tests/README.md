This folder, `tests`, contains the executable tests for DetectIndent.

## Running the tests

As a prerequisite, the [Vader](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim) testing plugin must be installed.

To run the tests, `cd` so your working is the root folder `detectindent`, *not* this `tests` folder. Then run the following:

    $ tests/run-tests

You should see output like the following:

[TODO] add example output, after all tests are passing
